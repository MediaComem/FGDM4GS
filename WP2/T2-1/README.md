# T2-1

This folder contains the code and documentation elements related to the **T2-1** task.
The sub-folders refer directly to the models selected in [**WP1/T1-1**](https://github.com/MediaComem/FGDM4GS/tree/main/WP1/T1-1#results) and are name after the model's name.
This resuts in the following resources:

- IVS_V2_1
- SectoralPlanForRoadInfrastructure_V1_4
- Axis_V1_1
- Zones_reservees_V1_1

_NOTE:_ a STRUCTURE cannot be instantiated (i.e. considered as an object) but can be integrated into a class in advance. A DOMAIN can be integrated into the TOPIC to which it relates but if it is associated with several classes of different TOPICS it must remain independent.
